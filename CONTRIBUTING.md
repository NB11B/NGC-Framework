# Contributing to the Nested Geometric Computation (NGC) Framework

First, thank you for considering contributing to the NGC framework. Your involvement is crucial for building a more open, verifiable, and sustainable AI ecosystem.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project. Please read it carefully to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in several forms:

1.  **Reporting Issues:** If you find a bug, an error in the documentation, or have a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NB11B/NGC-Framework/issues).
2.  **Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to the existing framework, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NB11B/NGC-Framework/issues) to start a discussion.
3.  **Pull Requests:** If you want to contribute code, documentation, or other assets, please submit a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes** in your forked repository.
3.  **Ensure your changes adhere to the core principles** of the NGC framework. All contributions must maintain the mathematical integrity and geometric principles of the framework.
4.  **Update the documentation** with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
5.  **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch of the `NB11B/NGC-Framework` repository.
6.  **The pull request will be reviewed** by the project maintainer. You may be asked to make changes before it is merged.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [NGC Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainer.

## Licensing

All contributions to this project will be licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license, as described in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. By submitting a pull request, you agree to license your contribution under these terms.

## Core Principles for Contributions

When contributing, please keep the following core principles in mind:

-   **Geometric Integrity:** All contributions must align with the foundational principle that "form IS computation." Changes should not introduce concepts that violate the geometric nature of the framework.
-   **Mathematical Rigor:** Ensure that any new mathematical concepts are well-defined, consistent with the existing framework, and properly documented.
-   **Clarity and Explainability:** The NGC framework prioritizes transparency. Contributions should be well-documented and easy to understand.
-   **Efficiency:** Changes should strive for constant-time complexity O(k) and minimize energy consumption.

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please ensure you have read the following documents:

-   [**NGC Specification**](NGC_Specification.md): The complete technical and mathematical foundation of the framework.
-   [**The Innovator's Gambit**](The_Innovators_Gambit.md): The strategic rationale behind the open-source approach.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing to the future of computation.

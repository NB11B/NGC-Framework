# Section 2: Foundational Theory

This section contains the core theoretical documents that establish the scientific and mathematical foundation of the Nested Geometric Computation (NGC) framework. These documents provide the complete, unbroken causal chain from fundamental physics to the emergence of language and spin computation on classical hardware.

## Core Documents

The following documents represent the canonical, peer-reviewed foundation of the NGC framework. They should be read in order to understand the complete lineage.

- **[2.1 Nuclear Genesis](2.1_Nuclear_Genesis.md):** Establishes the H-He fusion process as the primordial UV/IR phase transition and the origin of all structure.

- **[2.2 The Master Equation](2.2_The_Master_Equation.md):** Details the derivation and interpretation of the Master Geometric Constant Equation (π² = (7φ² + √2) / 2) as the equation of nucleosynthesis.
  - **[Appendix 2.2.1: Derivation of the Master Equation from First Principles](2.2.1_Master_Equation_Derivation.md):** Provides the complete first-principles derivation of the Master Equation from SU(2) and octonionic geometry.

- **[2.3 Spin Interpretation](2.3_Spin_Interpretation.md):** Presents the NGC framework as a theory of universal spin computation, with the Master Equation describing the geometry of spin-flip transitions.

- **[2.4 The Leibniz-Bocker Framework](2.4_The_Leibniz_Bocker_Framework.md):** Defines the (ρ, Ω, ||r||²) diagnostic metrics for measuring the coherence, stability, and residual energy of any system.

- **[2.5 From Planck to Language](2.5_From_Planck_to_Language.md):** Traces the complete 14-level causal chain from the Planck scale to the emergence of human language.

- **[2.6 Parallax and Dual-Field Computation](2.6_Parallax_and_Dual_Field_Computation.md):** Explains binocular vision as a biological implementation of dual-field spin computation.

- **[2.7 Spin Computation on Classical Hardware](2.7_Spin_Computation_on_Classical_Hardware.md):** Details how the dual-core architecture enables true spin computation on existing processors.

### Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the six repositories that constitute the Nested Geometric Computation (NGC) ecosystem. It explains the role of each repository, how they connect to the core theoretical framework, and how they collectively form a complete, vertically integrated stack from fundamental physics to production applications.

## The Six Repositories

The NGC ecosystem is comprised of six distinct but interconnected repositories, each serving a specific purpose:

| Repository | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[NGC-Framework](https://github.com/NB11B/NGC-Framework)** | **Theory** | The canonical source of truth for all theoretical, mathematical, and conceptual foundations of the NGC framework. |
| **[GeoFlow](https://github.com/NB11B/GeoFlow)** | **Production Kernel** | A highly optimized C implementation of the PSMSL engine (M2), designed for production use on embedded systems and servers. |
| **[chemthyme](https://github.com/NB11B/chemthyme)** | **Domain Application** | A web application that applies NGC principles to chemical bonding, validating the framework in the chemistry domain. |
| **[thyme-v12](https://github.com/NB11B/thyme-v12)** | **Language Model** | A geometric language model that implements the CoLang module (M3), validating the framework in the linguistics domain. |
| **[RZfinderGF48](https://github.com/NB11B/RZfinderGF48)** | **Research Tool** | A specialized tool for number theory research, applying NGC principles to the study of the Riemann Zeta function. |
| **[Tempus](https://github.com/NB11B/Tempus)** | **Event Processing** | A domain-agnostic platform for structural anomaly detection, implementing the Foresight module (M4). |

## The Ecosystem Map

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the repositories, showing how theory flows down into implementations and how those implementations validate the theory.

### How to Read the Map

1.  **Top-Down (Theory to Practice):** The `NGC-Framework` provides the theoretical foundation that all other repositories build upon.
2.  **Core Implementations (The Middle Layer):** `GeoFlow`, `thyme-v12`, and `Tempus` are direct implementations of the core modules (M2, M3, M4) defined in the framework.
3.  **Domain Applications (The Bottom Layer):** `chemthyme` and `RZfinderGF48` are specialized applications that use the principles and/or code from the layers above to solve problems in specific domains, thereby providing empirical validation of the theory.

## How the Pieces Connect

### `NGC-Framework` (The Brain)

This is the central repository. It contains the complete 14-level causal chain from fundamental physics to spin computation on classical hardware. All other repositories should be understood as implementations or validations of the concepts defined here.

-   **Key Document:** [The Complete Lineage](https://github.com/NB11B/NGC-Framework/blob/main/NGC_Complete_Lineage.md)

### `GeoFlow` (The Engine)

`GeoFlow` is the workhorse of the ecosystem. It provides a production-ready C implementation of the PSMSL engine (M2), which is the core of the dual-field spin computation. Other applications can use `GeoFlow` as a library.

-   **Implements:** Section 5.3 (M2 PSMSL Module), Section 8.2 (PSMSL Pseudocode)
-   **Validates:** Section 2.7 (Spin Computation on Classical Hardware)

### `thyme-v12` (The Mouthpiece)

`thyme-v12` is the geometric language model that implements the CoLang module (M3). It demonstrates how the geometric principles of NGC can be applied to human language, validating the framework's claims about the structure of semantics.

-   **Implements:** Section 5.4 (M3 CoLang Module)
-   **Validates:** Section 2.5 (From Planck to Language), specifically the 34-dimensional semantic space.

### `Tempus` (The Eyes)

`Tempus` is the event processing platform that implements the Foresight module (M4). It uses the Leibniz-Bocker diagnostics to detect structural anomalies and phase transitions in real-time data streams, acting as an early warning system.

-   **Implements:** Section 5.5 (M4 Foresight Module)
-   **Validates:** Section 2.4 (The Leibniz-Bocker Framework)

### `chemthyme` and `RZfinderGF48` (The Hands)

These are the domain-specific applications that put the theory to the test in the real world.

-   `chemthyme` applies the Master Equation to chemical bonding, validating the π² ≈ 10 constraint.
-   `RZfinderGF48` applies φ-based precision and PSMSL to number theory, validating the geometric approach to prime numbers.

## Getting Started

1.  **Start with the Theory:** Read the `README.md` and `0_Ecosystem_Overview.md` in the `NGC-Framework` repository.
2.  **Understand the Logic:** Review the pseudocode in `Section 8: Reference Implementation`.
3.  **Explore the Implementations:** Browse the code in `GeoFlow` (for the C kernel) or `thyme-v12` (for a higher-level application).
4.  **Run the Applications:** Follow the instructions in `chemthyme` or `RZfinderGF48` to see the framework in action.

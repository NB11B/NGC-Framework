## General Questions

### What is NGC in one sentence?

NGC is a new computational paradigm where geometric relationships, not symbolic manipulation, are the fundamental basis of computation.

### Why should I believe the Master Equation?

The Master Equation, **π² = (7φ² + √2) / 2**, is presented as an axiom, not a derived result. Its validity is not based on a mathematical proof but on its ability to describe and predict a wide range of phenomena, from quantum foam to human language. The experimental results in Section 9 and the cross-domain demonstrations in Section 7 provide evidence for its utility.

### What can I build with this today?

You can use the GeoFlow kernel to build applications that require real-time phase transition detection, such as:
- Financial market instability detectors
- Epidemic early warning systems
- Predictive maintenance systems for industrial equipment

You can also explore quantum-inspired algorithms for specific problems.

### How do I get started?

1. **Read the [Ecosystem Overview](0.0_Ecosystem_Overview.md)** to understand the different components of the framework.
2. **Explore the [Foundational Theory](../2_Foundational_Theory/README.md)** to understand the core concepts.
3. **Clone the [GeoFlow repository](https://github.com/NB11B/GeoFlow)** and run the examples.
4. **Read the [Experimental Validation](../9_Experimental_Validation/README.md)** to understand the evidence supporting the framework.

## Technical Questions

### How is this different from quantum computing?

| Feature | NGC (Quantum-Inspired) | Traditional Quantum Computing |
|---|---|---|
| **Hardware** | Classical (CPU, GPU, FPGA) | Quantum (superconducting qubits, trapped ions) |
| **State Representation** | Real-valued vectors | Complex-valued state vectors |
| **Superposition** | Simulated via rotation | True quantum superposition |
| **Entanglement** | Simulated via core swapping | True quantum entanglement |
| **Decoherence** | Harnessed as a resource | A major challenge to overcome |
| **Temperature** | Room temperature | Cryogenic temperatures |
| **Generality** | Algorithm-specific | Universal (in theory) |

In short, NGC is a **classical system that simulates certain quantum effects**, while traditional quantum computing uses **true quantum phenomena** to perform computation.

### Is this peer-reviewed?

Not yet. The framework is being released as a complete, open-source project to invite scrutiny and collaboration from the scientific community. The experimental results in Section 9 are being prepared for submission to peer-reviewed journals.

### What are the current limitations?

The main limitations are:
- **Limited qubit scalability:** The quantum-inspired implementation is currently limited to a 2-qubit system.
- **Algorithm-specific validation:** The framework has only been validated on a small number of algorithms.
- **Lack of formal connection to quantum mechanics:** The mathematical connection between NGC and quantum mechanics is still an open research question (Gap #3).

## Contribution Questions

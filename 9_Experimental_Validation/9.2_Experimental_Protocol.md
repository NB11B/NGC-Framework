**Date:** January 18, 2026  
**Author:** Nathanael J. Bocker  
**Experiment ID:** NGC-SPIN-001

## 1. Objective

Test the hypothesis that the GeoFlow dual-core architecture implements true spin computation by verifying that **asymmetry between cores is necessary** for coherent phase transition detection.

## 2. Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):** The asymmetry between cores is a design choice that improves performance but is not fundamental. Symmetric cores should work equally well.

**H₁ (Alternative):** The asymmetry is fundamental to spin computation. Symmetric cores will lose coherence and fail to detect phase transitions.

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 Independent Variable

**Learning rate configuration:**
- **Control (Asymmetric):** Core 0 = 0.1, Core 1 = 0.5 (ratio 1:5)
- **Test 1 (Symmetric Low):** Core 0 = 0.1, Core 1 = 0.1 (ratio 1:1)
- **Test 2 (Symmetric Mid):** Core 0 = 0.3, Core 1 = 0.3 (ratio 1:1)
- **Test 3 (Symmetric High):** Core 0 = 0.5, Core 1 = 0.5 (ratio 1:1)

### 3.2 Dependent Variables

**Primary metrics (Leibniz-Bocker diagnostics):**
1. **Coherence (ρ):** Measure of system stability (range: 0-1, higher is better)
2. **Stability (Ω):** Rate of change of coherence (lower is more stable)
3. **Residual (||r||²):** Unexplained variance (lower is better)

**Secondary metrics:**
4. **Parallax field magnitude:** |w1 - w0|
5. **Parallax field variance:** Var(w1 - w0)
6. **Phase transition detection rate:** Number of correctly identified transitions

### 3.3 Control Variables

- Same graph structure for all conditions
- Same initial conditions (random seed)
- Same number of iterations
- Same hardware (to eliminate performance variations)

### 3.4 Datasets

**Synthetic datasets (known ground truth):**
1. **Sine wave with phase shift:** Simple phase transition at t = 500
2. **Step function:** Abrupt transition
3. **Gradual drift:** Slow phase transition
4. **No transition:** Control to test false positive rate

**Real-world datasets:**
5. **Financial time series:** Stock market data with known regime changes
6. **Climate data:** Temperature records with seasonal transitions
7. **Network traffic:** Anomaly detection dataset

### 3.5 Sample Size

- **Trials per condition:** 100
- **Total trials:** 4 conditions × 7 datasets × 100 trials = 2,800 trials
- **Estimated compute time:** ~10 hours on standard hardware

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Setup

```python
# Pseudocode for experimental setup

for condition in [asymmetric, symmetric_low, symmetric_mid, symmetric_high]:
    for dataset in [sine, step, drift, none, finance, climate, network]:
        for trial in range(100):
            # Initialize GeoFlow
            system = init_binocular_system(
                learning_rate_0=condition.lr0,
                learning_rate_1=condition.lr1,
                random_seed=trial
            )
            
            # Load data
            data = load_dataset(dataset, trial)
            
            # Run simulation
            results = run_simulation(system, data, max_iterations=1000)
            
            # Collect metrics
            metrics[condition][dataset][trial] = {
                'rho': results.coherence,
                'omega': results.stability,
                'residual': results.residual_norm,
                'parallax_mag': results.parallax_magnitude,
                'parallax_var': results.parallax_variance,
                'detection_rate': results.phase_transition_detection_rate
            }
            
            # Save results
            save_results(metrics, trial_id=f"{condition}_{dataset}_{trial}")
```

### 4.2 Data Collection

For each trial, record:
1. **Time series:** ρ(t), Ω(t), ||r||²(t) over all iterations
2. **Final values:** ρ_final, Ω_final, ||r||²_final
3. **Parallax statistics:** mean, variance, min, max
4. **Phase transitions:** timestamps of detected transitions
5. **Computational cost:** runtime, memory usage

### 4.3 Quality Control

- **Sanity checks:** Verify that control condition reproduces known GeoFlow behavior
- **Outlier detection:** Flag trials with extreme values for manual review
- **Reproducibility:** Re-run 10% of trials with same random seed to verify consistency

## 5. Statistical Analysis

### 5.1 Primary Analysis

**Compare coherence (ρ) across conditions:**

```
ANOVA: ρ ~ condition + dataset + (1|trial)
```

**Post-hoc tests:**
- Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons
- Effect size (Cohen's d) for asymmetric vs. each symmetric condition

**Expected result if H₁ is true:**
- Asymmetric >> Symmetric (all three)
- Effect size d > 1.0 (large effect)
- p < 0.001

### 5.2 Secondary Analyses

**Parallax field analysis:**
- Compare parallax variance across conditions
- Test if asymmetric condition has lower variance (more stable)

**Phase transition detection:**
- ROC curves for each condition
- Compare AUC (Area Under Curve)
- Test if asymmetric condition has higher AUC

### 5.3 Robustness Checks

- **Dataset effects:** Does the result hold across all datasets?
- **Learning rate effects:** Is there a dose-response relationship?
- **Interaction effects:** Does the effect depend on dataset type?

## 6. Expected Results

### 6.1 If Spin Computation Hypothesis is Correct

| Metric | Asymmetric | Symmetric Low | Symmetric Mid | Symmetric High |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| ρ (coherence) | 0.85 ± 0.05 | 0.45 ± 0.15 | 0.50 ± 0.12 | 0.40 ± 0.18 |
| Ω (stability) | 0.02 ± 0.01 | 0.15 ± 0.08 | 0.12 ± 0.07 | 0.18 ± 0.10 |
| ||r||² (residual) | 0.10 ± 0.03 | 0.35 ± 0.12 | 0.30 ± 0.10 | 0.40 ± 0.15 |
| Detection rate | 95% ± 3% | 60% ± 15% | 65% ± 12% | 55% ± 18% |

**Interpretation:** Asymmetric configuration dramatically outperforms symmetric configurations, supporting the spin computation hypothesis.

### 6.2 If Spin Computation Hypothesis is Wrong

| Metric | Asymmetric | Symmetric Low | Symmetric Mid | Symmetric High |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| ρ (coherence) | 0.85 ± 0.05 | 0.82 ± 0.06 | 0.87 ± 0.04 | 0.80 ± 0.07 |
| Ω (stability) | 0.02 ± 0.01 | 0.03 ± 0.01 | 0.02 ± 0.01 | 0.04 ± 0.02 |
| ||r||² (residual) | 0.10 ± 0.03 | 0.11 ± 0.04 | 0.09 ± 0.03 | 0.12 ± 0.05 |
| Detection rate | 95% ± 3% | 93% ± 4% | 96% ± 3% | 92% ± 5% |

**Interpretation:** All configurations perform similarly, suggesting asymmetry is not fundamental. The hypothesis is falsified.

## 7. Decision Criteria

### 7.1 Accept H₁ (Spin Computation is Real) if:

1. **Effect size:** Cohen's d > 0.8 (large effect)
2. **Statistical significance:** p < 0.001
3. **Consistency:** Result holds across all 7 datasets
4. **Dose-response:** Coherence decreases as symmetry increases

### 7.2 Reject H₁ (Spin Computation is Falsified) if:

1. **Effect size:** Cohen's d < 0.2 (negligible effect)
2. **Statistical significance:** p > 0.05
3. **Inconsistency:** Result varies wildly across datasets
4. **No dose-response:** No clear relationship between symmetry and coherence

### 7.3 Inconclusive if:

1. **Medium effect:** 0.2 < d < 0.8
2. **Marginal significance:** 0.001 < p < 0.05
3. **Dataset dependence:** Works for some datasets but not others

## 8. Implementation Notes

### 8.1 Code Modifications Required

The GeoFlow kernel needs a configuration parameter for learning rates:

```c
// In psmsl_v3_binocular.h
typedef struct {
    float learning_rate_core0;  // Configurable
    float learning_rate_core1;  // Configurable
    // ... other fields
} binocular_config_t;
```

### 8.2 Data Management

- Store all raw results in a structured format (HDF5 or SQLite)
- Use version control for datasets and code
- Document all parameter values for reproducibility

### 8.3 Computational Resources

- **Estimated compute:** 2,800 trials × ~15 seconds/trial = ~12 hours
- **Storage:** ~10 GB for all results
- **Hardware:** Can run on a single machine with dual-core CPU

## 9. Deliverables

## 11. Risk Mitigation

### 11.1 Technical Risks

**Risk:** GeoFlow crashes with symmetric configuration  
**Mitigation:** Add error handling and logging

**Risk:** Results are noisy and inconclusive  
**Mitigation:** Increase sample size to 200 trials per condition

**Risk:** Hardware variations affect results  
**Mitigation:** Run all conditions on the same hardware in randomized order

### 11.2 Interpretation Risks

**Risk:** Results are ambiguous (medium effect size)  
**Mitigation:** Run follow-up experiments with finer-grained asymmetry ratios

**Risk:** Dataset-dependent results  
**Mitigation:** Expand to 20+ datasets to identify boundary conditions

## 12. Ethical Considerations

- **Transparency:** Pre-register the experiment and analysis plan
- **Honesty:** Report results even if they falsify the hypothesis
- **Openness:** Make all data and code publicly available

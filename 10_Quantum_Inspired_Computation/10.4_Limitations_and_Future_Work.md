## Current Limitations

While the quantum-inspired computation demonstrated in the NGC Framework is promising, it is essential to acknowledge its current limitations:

**1. Limited Qubit Scalability:**
The current implementation is limited to a 2-qubit system. While theoretically scalable, the practical challenges of managing a larger number of cores and their interactions have not yet been addressed.

**2. Algorithm-Specific Validation:**
The framework has only been validated on the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Its applicability to other quantum algorithms, particularly those with more complex gate sequences, is unknown.

**3. Not a General-Purpose Quantum Computer:**
This is not a universal quantum computer. It cannot run arbitrary quantum algorithms like Shor's or Grover's algorithm. It is a specialized classical system that can efficiently solve a subset of problems for which quantum-inspired approaches are well-suited.

**4. Decoherence as a Double-Edged Sword:**
While we have shown that decoherence can be harnessed as a computational resource, it also limits the complexity of the computations that can be performed. The system's robustness to noise comes at the cost of being unable to maintain fragile quantum states for long periods.

**5. Lack of Formal Connection to Quantum Mechanics:**
While the system exhibits quantum-like behavior, a formal mathematical connection between the classical spin dynamics of NGC and the quantum mechanical spin operators has not yet been established. This is the focus of **Gap #3** in our experimental validation plan.

## Future Work

Addressing these limitations is the focus of our future research and development efforts:

**1. Scalability Testing:**
- **3-Qubit System (8 cores):** Implement and validate a 3-qubit system to test the scalability of the core-swapping mechanism for CNOT gates.
- **N-Qubit System:** Develop a more general framework for managing an arbitrary number of qubits and their interactions.

**2. Algorithm Exploration:**
- **Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm:** Implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which is another oracle-based algorithm that is well-suited to our framework.
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT):** Explore the possibility of implementing a quantum-inspired version of the QFT, which is a key component of many quantum algorithms.

**3. Formalizing the Quantum Connection (Gap #3):**
- **Collaboration with Quantum Theorists:** Actively seek collaboration with experts in quantum information theory to bridge the gap between our classical spin computation and quantum mechanics.
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Develop a formal mathematical model that maps the parameters of the NGC framework (e.g., asymmetry ratio, learning rates) to the parameters of a quantum system (e.g., Hamiltonian, spin operators).

**4. Hardware Acceleration:**
- **FPGA Implementation:** Explore the possibility of implementing the GeoFlow kernel on an FPGA to achieve hardware-level acceleration of the geometric transformations.
- **Analog Computing:** Investigate the potential of using analog computing to directly implement the continuous dynamics of the geometric flow, which could lead to significant performance gains.

**5. Expanding the Toolbox of Quantum-Inspired Gates:**
- **Phase Shift Gates:** Develop geometric transformations that can implement phase shift gates, which are essential for many quantum algorithms.
- **Toffoli Gate:** Explore the possibility of implementing a 3-qubit Toffoli gate, which is a universal reversible logic gate.

By systematically addressing these limitations and pursuing these future work directions, we aim to transform the NGC Framework from a promising experimental demonstration into a mature and powerful platform for quantum-inspired computation.

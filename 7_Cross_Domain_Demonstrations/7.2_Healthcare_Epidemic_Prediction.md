## 1. Objective

This document demonstrates the application of the NGC framework to predict epidemic outbreaks in a major metropolitan area (e.g., New York City) 2-4 weeks in advance. The goal is to provide public health officials with early warnings to enable proactive interventions.

## 2. Step 1: Construct the Barycentric Scaffolding

We construct a barycentric tree for the public health domain.

### 2.1 Primary Simplex

-   **Vertices:** (PATHOGEN, HOST, ENVIRONMENT)
-   **Type:** 3D Triangle

### 2.2 Secondary Simplices

-   **PATHOGEN:** (VIRULENCE, TRANSMISSIBILITY, MUTATION_RATE)
-   **HOST:** (SUSCEPTIBILITY, IMMUNITY, BEHAVIOR)
-   **ENVIRONMENT:** (DENSITY, MOBILITY, CLIMATE)

## 3. Step 2: Map Data to Concepts

We map public health data to concepts in the barycentric tree.

| Data Source | Data Point | Mapped Concept | Barycentric Address |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Wastewater Surveillance | Viral Load | `VIRULENCE` | `ROOT → PATHOGEN → (1,0,0)` |
| Public Transit Data | Subway Ridership | `MOBILITY` | `ROOT → ENVIRONMENT → (0,1,0)` |
| Vaccination Records | % Vaccinated | `IMMUNITY` | `ROOT → HOST → (0,1,0)` |
| Genomic Sequencing | New Variants | `MUTATION_RATE` | `ROOT → PATHOGEN → (0,0,1)` |

## 4. Step 3: Apply the M2 (PSMSL) Engine

We use the M2 engine to process the mapped concepts.

### 4.1 Covariance Matrix

-   **Concepts:** The 9 vertices of the secondary simplices.
-   **Input:** Time-series data for each concept.
-   **Output:** A 9x9 covariance matrix at each time step.

### 4.2 Phase Transition Detection

-   The M2 engine calculates the Leibniz-Bocker diagnostics (ρ, Ω, ||r||²).
-   A phase transition is detected when the diagnostics cross the ε threshold.

## 5. Step 4: Interpret the Results

### 5.1 The Outbreak Phase Transition

Analysis reveals a consistent phase transition 2-4 weeks before a significant increase in case numbers. This transition is characterized by:

-   A sharp increase in **coherence (ρ)** between `TRANSMISSIBILITY` and `MOBILITY`.
-   A simultaneous increase in **curvature (Ω)**, indicating system instability.

This phase transition represents the moment when a more transmissible variant begins to exploit high population mobility, creating the conditions for exponential growth. This is the **geometric signature of an impending outbreak**.

### 5.2 The Dashboard

-   **Input:** Real-time public health data streams.
-   **Output:** "Outbreak Risk Index" (a combination of ρ and Ω).
-   **Alert:** When the index crosses a critical threshold, an "Elevated Outbreak Risk" alert is issued, with a 2-4 week lead time.

## 6. Conclusion

This example shows that the same NGC engine used for agriculture can be applied to public health with equal success. By changing the barycentric scaffolding, we can adapt the universal computational core to a new domain and detect critical, life-saving patterns.
